# Overview

[Shipyard](https://shipyard.khulnasoft.com) is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With Shipyard, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, Shipyard helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

Shipyard supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, Dynamodb, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more! The [Pro version of Shipyard](https://shipyard.khulnasoft.com/pricing) supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [‚òëÔ∏è Feature Coverage](https://docs.shipyard.khulnasoft.com/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

Shipyard also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud developer easier! Check out Shipyard's [User Guides](https://docs.shipyard.khulnasoft.com/user-guide/) for more information.

## Installation

The quickest way get started with Shipyard is by using the Shipyard CLI. It enables you to start and manage the Shipyard Docker container directly through your command line. Ensure that your machine has a functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed before proceeding.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

Install the Shipyard CLI through our [official Shipyard Brew Tap](https://github.com/khulnasoft/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install shipyard/tap/shipyard-cli
```

### Binary download (MacOS, Linux, Windows)

If Brew is not installed on your machine, you can download the pre-built Shipyard CLI binary directly:

- Visit [khulnasoft/shipyard-cli](https://github.com/khulnasoft/shipyard-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable:
    -   For MacOS/Linux, use the command: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/shipyard-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (MacOS, Linux, Windows)

Shipyard is developed using Python. To install the Shipyard CLI using `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install shipyard
```

The `shipyard-cli` installation enables you to run the Docker image containing the Shipyard runtime. To interact with the local AWS services, you need to install the `awslocal` CLI separately. For installation guidelines, refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.shipyard.khulnasoft.com/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#shipyard-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. Shipyard must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user shipyard`

## Quickstart

Start Shipyard inside a Docker container by running:

```bash
 % shipyard start -d

     __                     _______ __             __
    / /   ____  _________ _/ / ___// /_____ ______/ /__
   / /   / __ \/ ___/ __ `/ /\__ \/ __/ __ `/ ___/ //_/
  / /___/ /_/ / /__/ /_/ / /___/ / /_/ /_/ / /__/ ,<

You can query the status of respective services on Shipyard by running:

```bash
% shipyard status services

‚îÇ dynamodb                 ‚îÇ ‚úî available ‚îÇ
...
```

To use SQS, a fully managed distributed message queuing service, on Shipyard, run:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
{
    "QueueUrl": "http://sqs.us-east-1.localhost.shipyard.khulnasoft.com:4566/000000000000/sample-queue"
}
```
